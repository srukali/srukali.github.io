			<h2>About me</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			<center><img src = "images/circlehead2.png" height="150" width="150"><br></center>
			<p>I'm Katelyn, a Digital Arts and Sciences (DAS) student at the University of Florida, a slave to my internet connection, and a fervent believer in the Oxford comma. My interests include Human-Computer Interaction, User Experience, Web Development, Mobile Development, Graphic Design, and Product Management. (Pretty much a little bit of everything.)
			<p>In case you were interested, DAS is a discipline where computer science and art intersect - the curriculum includes working with 3D modeling and animation software, Java GUI, immersion into video game development, and electives that let a student explore a greater breadth of artistic knowledge on design and aesthetics. I think it's a fantastic and unique program that offers me opportunities I wouldn't have found elsewhere.
			<p>In my spare time, which is hard to come by these days, I enjoy baking up some cupcakes, watching an episode of my latest favorite show on Netflix, or tending to my orchid that I'm determined to get blooming again. At nights you may find me hanging out with my ball python Koa, or rather she may be hanging out on me.

			<h2>My Projects</h2>
			<div class="content">
			<br>
			<h3><span class="byline">| L-System Explorer</span></h3> 
			This was my final project for the class Intro to Digital Arts and Sciences. In this program, you can choose from a variety of pre-made L-systems,
			change a few of the many variables to experiment with the outcomes, or try to create your own rules for a brand new L-system.

			<h3><span class="byline">| Web Design</span></h3> 
			Here lie some of my projects in web design that I've dabbled in, either personal or for class.
			<a href="java-kate.com/webdesign" class="button">My Web Designs</a></center>
			<br><br><br>
			
			<h3><span class="byline">| Coming Soon... Speedy Keys, the Xbox keyboard</span></h3> 
			I served as the Product Manager in this group project for Human Computer Interaction. We had to choose an interface that we wanted to
			improve, so we chose to improve the tedious text-entry process on the Xbox. My role was to evaluate the customer's needs and ensure that
			our final design was user-centered. We are currently in progress with development.
			<br><br><br>
			
			<h3><span class="byline">| Coming Soon... Origin, the Android Game</span></h3> 
			I was the Aesthetic Lead in this team project for my class Theory and Practice of Multimedia Production, where we get to make a 
			video game on a platform of our choosing. We are currently developing the game in Unity 2D.
			<br><br><br>

			<h3><span class="byline">| Artwork</span></h3> 
			In my spare time, I enjoy working with different mediums to produce varieties of artwork. From traditional pencil and paint, to 
			digital paintings, to 3D models, you'll find some of my work on my DeviantArt profile. Click the button below to explore!
